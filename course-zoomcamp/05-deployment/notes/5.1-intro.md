# 5.1 Intro / Session overview Notes

This week: Deploying Machine Learning models
- See [Jupyter Notebook](../code/05-train-churn-model.ipynb) for training code
- Want to save model to be loaded in production **webservice**.
    - E.g. Churn model
        - Marketing service can send user information to churn prediction service
        - Churn service uses model to predict churn probability and return to marketing
        - Marketing service sends email if user may churn
- Will use **Flask** to load model prediction code
- Need to isolate Python dependencies: can use **Pipenv**
- Then need to isolate system dependencies: we will use **Docker**
- Then we will deploy this Docker container to the cloud using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
