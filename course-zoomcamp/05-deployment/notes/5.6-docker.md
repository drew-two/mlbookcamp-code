# 5.6 Environment Manager: Docker

Docker isolates the entire application from the rest of your computer
- E.g. you have host machine with Ubuntu or OS
    - You have multiple different virtual environments for each service
    - Each service has certain Python and system dependencies
- Docker provides a *container* for each service, and not know anything about each other
    - Churn service thinks it is the only thing running on the computer
- Environment only has what the service needs and nothing else
    - E.g. churn service needs Ubuntu 18.04, lead scoring servic needs Ubuntu 20.04
        - Email service uses Perl on Amazon Linux
        - Maybe lead scoring needs g++ for some library, but not the others, so they will not have g++
    - Each service has its own version of Python
- Host machine can be basically only OS. e.g. Ubuntu 18.04
    - Can run many containers with whatever OS
- Containers can be deployed basically directly to cloud

### Python in Docker
Need to find docker Python image (https://hub.docker.com/_/python)
- Using 3.8.12-slim - based on debian slim
    - Can use apt-get etc
- Can run image with `docker run -it --rm python:3.8.12-slim`
    - `-it` means to open terminal
    -  `--rm` means remove image after run
- If image is not saved locally it will be downloaded by docker
- Not necessarily useful, may want to use bash shell
- To access image directly, ovewrite entrypoint:
    - `docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash python:3.8.12-slim` 
    - Then we can do `apt-get update && apt-get install wget`
    - This only affects container and not host machine

### Dockerfile
Create a file called Dockerfile. Can choose container OS, files, and run commands
- First add base image `FROM python:3.8.12-slim`
- Add pipenv via `pip install pipenv`
- Can specify work directory `WORKDIR /app`
    - Creates /app if it does not exist and changes directory to /app
- Can copy files to container `COPY ["Pipfile", "Pipfile.lock", "./"]
    - Each token separated as string, last token always destination in container
- Can build image with `docker build -t zoomcamp-test .`
    - `-t` is used to tag image
    - `.` used to get Dockerfile from cwd
- Can run image now `docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash zoomcamp-test
    - Starts in cwd /app. Here you can run `pipenv install`
    - Do not actually want to do this manually
- Can install pipenv environment in container `RUN pipenv install`
    - Note that we do not actually want the virtual environment in the container as we do not need it
    - Can do this with `RUN pipenv install --system --deploy`
        - Installs to main Python directory (--system) and aborts if issue with Pipfile/Pipfile.lock (--deploy)
    - Will have all necessary libraries/commands in container now
- Copy predict.py and model file in `COPY ["predict.py", "model_C=1.0.bin", "./"]`
    - Now all the files are in the container adn you can run gunicorn
- CANNOT access gunicorn outside container yet
    - Inside the container there are programs running and say port 9696 is in use
        - Say host machine also has its own ports
    - Want this port to be open to the host machine as well as container
        - Test script needs to be able to just use port to access service in docker container
    - So, we will map 9696 of the host machine to 9696 of the container
- Expose port with `EXPOSE 9696`
- Specify entrypoint with `ENTRYPOINT ["gunicorn", "--bind=0.0.0.0:9696", "predict:app"]`

Test server with predict-test.py
- Fails - why?
- We exposed the port but did not create mapping

Run dockerfile with `docker run -it --rm -p9696:9696 zoomcamp-test
- Can now access with predict-test.py
