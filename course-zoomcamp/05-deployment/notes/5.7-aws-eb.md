# 5.7 Deployment to the Cloud: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (optional)

Alternatives:
- Heroku
- Google Cloud
- Azure
- Python Anywhere

Pre-requisite: 
- AWS account
- CLI key for AWS

Create EC2 instance (optional)
- SSH in. Much faster to use EC2 instance

## Elastic Beanstalk
End-to-end web application management
- Easy way to deploy web services, including docker containers

Say we have the churn service running in EB in AWS
- We have a marketing service elsewhere. It connects to EB, which connects to the churn service and then returns the same way
- Say there are more services that access the churn service
    - EB will notice this and scale up the churn service automatically and perform load balancing
    - Called **scaling up**
- Say these services finish up and we no longer need multiple instances of churn service
    - EB will **scale down** the churn service and remove extra instance

Need to AWS EB CLI
- Do not want to install system-wide
- Install with `pipenv install awsebcli --dev`
    - Development dependency: only needed for development and will not be installed for deploys
- Run `pipenv shell` to use awsebcli
- Create EB project with `eb init -p docker -r us-east-1 churn-serving`
    - Creates .elasticbeanstalk/ directory
        - Check config.yaml in directory
- Can now test locally before deploy `eb local run --port 9696`
    - Reinstalls Pipfile from scratch as we added elastic beanstalk

Now we can test
- To make more interesting, change 'tenure' to 12 months in [predict-test.py](../code/predict-test.py)
    - Test with predict-test.py
- Can deploy to eb now with `eb create churn-serving-env`
    - Will output some information about host machine and platform
    - Creating many things under the hood:
        - Security group
        - Load balancer
        - Auto scaling group
        - CloudWatch alarm
    - Returns address of deployed service
- Can use deployed address (do not need to specify port) to predict with predict-test.py
- **NOTE**: this EB address is open to the world and you need to be careful

## Summary
- Installed AWS EB CLI
- Ran EB locally
- Deployed EB model in cloud
