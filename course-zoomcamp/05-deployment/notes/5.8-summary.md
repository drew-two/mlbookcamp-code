# 5.8 Summary

This week was very important as it gave a way for other services to use our prediction service.
- Model would be useless without this step

1. Took model trained from previous two weeks (churn prediction model)
2. Saved and loaded model with pickle
    - Converted Jupyter notebook to script
3. Using Flask to make simple web service
4. Use Flask to serve churn model
    - Wrap predict script into Flask app
    - Query it with `requests`
    - Prepare it for production: gunicorn
5. Use Pipenv for Python virtual environments
    - Why we need virtual environments
    - Installing Pipenv
    - Creating Pipfile and dev dependencies
    - Running things with Pipenv
6. Using Docker for system environment management
    - Why we need Docker
    - Creating/running Python image with Docker
    - Creating Dockerfile
    - Building and running Docker images
7. Deploying Docker files to the cloud with AWS EB (optional)
    - Installing the EB CLI
    - Running EB locally
    - Deploying to EB on the cloud
