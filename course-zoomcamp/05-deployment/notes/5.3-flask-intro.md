# 5.3 Flask Introduction

Flask is a web service framework in the form of a Python module.

Do not want to run model prediction from every web server or on marketing department computer. How do we handle this?
- Make it available via URL with a webserver
- What a webserver?
    - Method for communicating between 2 devices over a network
    - E.g. Communicating to Google web service where your query is the parameter
        - Return is the Google search results

Creating a simple service
- We will create a simple web service that returns "PONG" when we send "PING"
- Open [ping.py](../code/ping.py).
    - Import flask from flask
    - Create app with `app = Flask('app name')`
    - Create function ping() that returns "PONG"
    - Add decorator with `@app.route()` with the URL and HTTP command
    - Add `app.run()` into the main method
        - URL and port are optional; set URL to localhost for testing and port 9696 is convention
- Run server with `python ping.py`
    - Can hit ping with `curl localhost:9696/ping`
        - Do not need to specify http
    - Can also access 'http://localhost:9696/ping' in browser
