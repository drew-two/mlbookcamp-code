# 5.4 Serving the Churn Model

Need to create web service with our ML model.
- E.g. Churn prediction model
    - Web service loads model for prediction
    - Allow access to model at /predict
    - Marketing service can call this to see churn probability of customer

Converting [predict.py](../code/predict.py) to a Flask webservice
- `from flask import Flask`
- `from flask import request`
- `from flask import jsonify`
- Create app with `app = Flask('churn)
- Add route decorator to `predict()`
    - `@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])`
    - Using post as we want to send information to web service
- Get JSON from `predict()` with `request.get_json()`
    - Flask will handle this for us, we do not need to add function arguments
    - `customer = request.get_json()`
- Marketing service is not deciding churn so set decision threshold for return
- Create dictionary in `predict()` to return answer as JSON
    - Create Python dictionary with chrun probability and churn decision, call it `result`
    - Ideally you would put code for prediction in separate function from web service function
- Add `app.run` when running code as script
    ```
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=9696)
    ```

Communicating with webservice
- Cannot access via web browser - browser sends GET request, we want POST request
- Open [Jupyter notebook](../code/05-train-churn-model.ipynb#Making%20requests)
    - Go to 'Making Requests' at the bottom
    - `import requests`
    - Set URL as `url`
    - Set dummy customer data dictionary as `customer`
    - Send request to URL with
        - `response = requests.post(url, json=customer)`
- Error: `TypeError: Object of type bool_ is not JSON serializable`
    - Type bool_ coming from NumPy, and JSON module does not know how turn this into text
- Go back to [predict.py](../code/predict.py)
    - In `predict()`, return dictionary:
        - Cast churn probability to `float`
        - Cast churn prediction to `bool`
- Post request should work now. Cannot see content however
    - Can see content with `.json()`
    - `response = requests.post(url, json=customer).json()`
- Check content of `response` variable by accessing key `churn`
    ```
    if response['churn']:
        print('sending email to', 'asdx-123d')
    ```

Handling production server warning
- Want to use production WSGI server instead: gunicorn
- Run `pip install gunicorn`
- Run with `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:9696 predict:app`
    - Uses `predict` from predict.py
    - Web server variable is `app` from `app = Flask('churn')`
    - `--bind` should be the same URL and port set in the 'main' statement of predict.py

Gunicorn does not work with Windows. Using Unix specific features
- If you try to run it on Windows, it will be missing module `fcntl`
    - This is for a Unix specific feature
- Alternative for gunicorn is *waitress*
    - Command is `waitress-serve --listen=0.0.0.0:8001 predict:app`
        - `--listen` instead of `--bind`
- See some warnings about scikit-learn compatibility
    - Want to avoid these in future. How?
    - Next lesson

## Review
- Wrapped predict.py script into Flask app
- Querying it with module `requests`
- Preparing it for production with `gunicorn` WSGI server
- Running it on Windows with waitress
