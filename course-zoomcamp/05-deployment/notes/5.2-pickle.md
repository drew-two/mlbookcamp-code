# 5.2 Saving and loading model

See [Jupyter Notebook](../code/05-train-churn-model.ipynb).
- Everything needed for training is here.
- Trains Logistic Regression model on week 4 credit card data
    - C = 1.0
    - Use 5-fold CV
- Save model using pickle (built in Python module)
    - First need to create file that is writing bytes using Python open function
        - Use open() option 'wb' to write bytes (bytes as we are not writing text)
    - Use `pickle.dump()` to write model to file name (also needed fitted Dictionary Vectorizer)
    - Close file (need to do this to make sure file has been written and that other programs can open it)
    ```
    import pickle
    output_file = f'model_C={C}.bin'
    f_out = open(output_file, 'wb') 
    pickle.dump((dv, model), f_out)
    f_out.close()
    ```
    - Can also do the following to make sure file is closed:
    ```
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out: 
    pickle.dump((dv, model), f_out)
    ```
- Loading model with pickle
    - Need file path and name from saving
    - Make sure to use open() option 'rb' to read bytes
        - r is for reading, do not want to overwrite
        - b is for bytes, we did not write text
    ```
    input_file = 'model_C=1.0.bin'
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in: 
    dv, model = pickle.load(f_in)
    ```
    - Need sklearn installed to properly open `dv` as Dict Vectorizer
- Testing model:
    - Dummy customer given from top of dataset
    - Need to transformer using `dv`
    - Predict probability with model and get probability from output
    ```
    X = dv.transform([customer])
    y_pred = model.predict_proba(X)[0, 1]
    ```

Using Jupyter is not convenient for repeating experiments or production. How do we handle this?
- Convert notebook to Python script
- Can do this from Jupyter in web browser; File > Download as > Python (.py)
- Cleaned up and saved to [train.py](../code/train.py).
    - Delete Jupyter commands
    - Clean input and output 
    - Put parameters and imports to the top of the file
    - Add some comments explaining what script is doing
    - Add some print statements for visibility and logging
