# 5.6 Python Virtual Environment: Pipenv

### Recall
We install packages with `pip install <package>`
- pip checks for your Python path in $PATH
    - If you use anaconda it checks ~/anaconda3/bin/pip (and ~/anaconda3/bin/python)
    - There is a library folder under ~/anaconda3
- Checks pypi.org (the package index) then installs latest version

Say our churn service uses scikit-learn==0.24.2 (also how we specify version for pip)
- However, our churn service uses scikit-learn==1.0, a different version
- How do we make sure that everything each service is there (e.g. from regression)?
- We use **virtual environments**

### Virtual environments
Run each service in its own virtual environment
- Each service gets it own version of dependcies and are isolated
- Churn service python version may live in ~/venv/churn/bin/python
    - Whereas lead scoring service may live in ~/venv/lead/bin/python
- Thus they have versions of scikit-learn that do not conflict

### Virtual environment tools
- virtualenv (venv) - classic built-in Python virtual env manager
    - Useful as it is always there but not the most powerful
- conda - heavier package manager that handles python versioning as well
    - has its own package manager
- pipenv - officially recommended python package manager
- poetry - 'cooler', more modern but not as common

### Pipenv
- Install with `pip install pipenv`
- Install package with `pipenv install numpy scikit-learn==0.24.2 flask`
    - Use this version for this project
- Pipenv creates Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
    - Pipfile lists Python verison, packages, versions (if specified), and dev packages (only need for development but not production)
- Try `pipenv install gunicorn`
    - Notice it adds gunicorn to Pipfile
    - Anyone who installs this repo just needs to run `pipenv install` to recreate environment
- See Pipfile.lock
    - Contains exact version for every dependency
    - Each dependency has a sha256 checksum to be certain about versions
        - When you recreate the environment it makes sure the checksums match
- Can run `pipenv shell` to activate virtual environment in shell
    - Shows directory `/home/<user>/.local/share/virtualenvs/notes-<xxxxxxxx>/bin/activate`
    - This folder contains the python, pip, packages and activation for virtual environment
    - Checking $PATH shows the path to the virtual enviroment at the start
        - Pipenv prepends the virtual env path to $PATH
        - Thus typing `which gunicorn` shows the gunicorn from the virtual environment as it gets the venv version of gunicorn first
    - Typing `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:9696 predict:app` from shell runs it with the new version of gunicorn
- Running `pipenv <command>` is the same as activating `pipenv shell` first then running the command

What if we need a specific version of a system library unrelated to Python?
