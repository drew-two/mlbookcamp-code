Example scenario
- User wants to sell car, needs coming up with the best price.
- Want to develop model to provide a sales price.

For that we're using a car price dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset)
- Has features like model, make, year, engine, fuel type, etc ... and price
	- MSRP (price) is our target feature

Project plan
- Prepare data and do EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Use linear regression for predicting price
- Understanding the internals of linear regression (implement ourselves)
- Evaluating the model with RMSE (score)
- Feature engineering (processing of creating new features)
- Regularization (see how we can solve numerical stability problems)
- Using the model

All the code is avaiable under chapter-02-car-price/ in the project root
