* Check missing values
* Look at the target variable (churn)
* Look at numerical and categorical variables

```python
# Drop indices for readability
df_full_train = df_full_train.reset_index(drop=True)
df_full_train.head().T
```

Check for missing values.

```python
df_full_train.isnull().sum()
```

No additional data preparation here, we already checked for missing values.

Let's look at the target variable.

```python
df_full_train.churn.value_counts(normalize=True)
```

We see that the number of churned users is almost 1/3rd of non-churned users. **0.269968** is our **churn rate**.

Just getting the mean() gives us the churn rate.

```python
global_churn_rate = df_full_train.churn.mean()
round(global_churn_rate, 2)
```

This works because, for a binary variable, the negative value is 0 and the positive value is 1, so only positive values contribute to the mean, giving us the same value as the proportion. Essentially:
- (# of 1s)/*n* = Churn Rate


Let's look at the other variables now. Let's check numerical and categorical variables

```python
df_full_train.dtypes
```

Only tenure, monthlycharges, and totalcharges are numerical (seniorcitizen is a binary value.)

```python
numerical = ['tenure', 'monthlycharges', 'totalcharges']
```

```python
categorical = [
    'gender',
    'seniorcitizen',
    'partner',
    'dependents',
    'phoneservice',
    'multiplelines',
    'internetservice',
    'onlinesecurity',
    'onlinebackup',
    'deviceprotection',
    'techsupport',
    'streamingtv',
    'streamingmovies',
    'contract',
    'paperlessbilling',
    'paymentmethod',
]
```

Let's take a look of the number of unique values for categorical variables.

```python
df_full_train[categorical].nunique()
```
