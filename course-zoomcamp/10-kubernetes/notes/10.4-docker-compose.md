# 10.4 - Docker-Compose

Look at ![overview](../images/10.1-overview.png)
- We have loaded the model with TF-Serving in Docker
    - Uses the official Tensorflow image and mounting model into container
- Created Flask application to be the gateway and communicate with model
    - Loads, preprocesses image and communicates with gRPC and protobuf
- Created virtual env with Pipenv

Now want to run both of these in Docker now and run at the same time.

## Docker Compose

[Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) let's you specify multiple Docker containers for larger application
- Configured with YAML file and deployed with one command
- Useful for testing multiple containers ad-hoc or quickly integration testing without Kubernetes
- Supports only recreating changed containers on-the-fly

## Preparing TF-Serving Docker Image

Recall how we loaded with Docker:
```
docker run -it --rm \
 -p 8500:8500 \
 -v "$(pwd)/clothing-model:/models/clothing-model/1" \
 -e MODEL_NAME="clothing-model" \
 tensorflow/serving:2.7.0
```
- MODEL_NAME and internal path must match

Now install of specifying everything with `docker run`, we want to put everything in the Docker image
- Image should be completely self-contained

Create [Dockerfile](../image-model.dockerfile)
- Just need to:
    - Copy model in
    - Specify env variable
- Build with `docker build -t zoomcamp-10-model:xception-v4-001 -f image-model.dockerfile .`
- Now we can just run it with :
```
docker run -it --rm \
 -p 8500:8500 \
 zoomcamp-10-model:xception-v4-001
```

Run Docker container and test with [gateway script](../gateway.py)
- Should work

## Preparing Gateway Docker Image
Can copy from [fifth section](../../05-deployment/code/Dockerfile)
- Edit to copy in `gateway.py` and `proto.py` instead of other scripts
- Edit `predict` to `gateway` in `ENTRYPOINT`

Build it with:
- `docker build -t zoomcamp-10-model:001 -f image-gateway.dockerfile .`

Now prepare another Docker command to run the container:
```
docker run -it --rm \
 -p 9696:9696 \
 zoomcamp-10-model:xception-v4-001
```

Now we can test it with [test.py](../test.py)
- This should fail. This is because:
    - Docker connects both ports from their internal IP port to the localhost
    - [test.py](../test.py) can connect to http://localhost:9696 and connect to the gateway
    - The gateway will then try to connect to gRPC://localhost:8500, but fails
        - This is because it interprets `localhost` as in the container, not the host machine
    - Need to be able to link these services in one network
        - Can do this in Docker, but we will use docker-compose instead
- Need to install docker-compose on Mac and Linux. On Windows it comes with Docker desktop
    - Alexey then talks about installing it in Linux then adding it to Path
    - Adds `export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"` to `~/.bashrc` to prepend to PATH at shell launch
    - Can restart terminal or run `source .bashrc`

Now we need to make [docker compose file](../docker-compose.yaml)
- Can see example in the [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/#step-3-define-services-in-a-compose-file)
    - Example opens redis DB at port 5000:5000
    - Changes:
        - Replace `web` with `clothing-model`
        - Replace `build` with `image`
        - Move ports out of clothing-model as it is not needed within network
        - Replace `redis` with `gateway`
        - Add port mapping with `ports` to "9696:9696" as we still need to access externally
    - Need to make host in gateway *dynamic*, instead of hardcoded
        - Need to use **environment variables**
        - Change rvalue of host to `os.getenv('TF_SERVING_HOST', 'localhost:8500')`
- Rebuild gateway image and increment to `002`
- Go back to editing [docker compose file](../docker-compose.yaml)
    - Increment version for gateway image
    - Add *environment variables* with `environment` under `gateway`
        - Use `TF_SERVING_HOST` for name as we did in gateway.py
        - Use `"clothing-model:8500"` for the value

## Running Docker Compose

Make sure you're in the same folder as all the files, then run: `docker-compose up`
- Will see output of both images in same terminal
- Try testing with `test.py`
    - Should fail
    - Need to edit [docker compose file](../docker-compose.yaml) and remove quotes from TF_SERVING_HOST

## Other Useful stuff
- Close gracefully by typing `^C`
- Can run docker-compose in background with `docker-compose up -d`
- Can see everything running in docker with `docker pose`
- Can close background docker compose with `docker-compose down`

## Recap
1. Convert Jupyter notebook to scripts
    - Clean up
    - Add methods
    - Quickly test again
2. Containerize both scripts and create Dockerfiles
3. Create docker-compose file
    - Add both models
    - Add environment variable for URL of any other containers a container may need to connect to
4. Run `docker-compose up`
5. Test
