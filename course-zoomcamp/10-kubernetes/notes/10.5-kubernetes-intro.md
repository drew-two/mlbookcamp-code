# 10.5 - Introduction to Kubernetes

If you Google Kubernetes and go to the [official page](https://kubernetes.io/), we can see that:
- "Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."

This means we can use Kubernetes to deploy Docker images. Handles everything for us:
- Will deploy these
- Will manage these
- Will scale up/down if needed

## Kubernetes Cluster Anatomy

![Cluster](../images/10.5-cluster.png)

Has "nodes" where things are running.
    - "nodes" ~= server/computer (EC2 instance)
    - Each node can have multiple containers/pods

Pod is a discrete running instance of something
    - "pods" ~= container with specific parameters
Some pods may take up more CPU/RAM resources

Pods are grouped by **deployments**
    - "deployment" ~= group of pods with same image/configuration
    - All the pods within one deployment have the same docker image
    - E.g. Small pods are the gateway service. All have the same image `zoomcamp-10-gateway:002`
        - All the same parameters and configurations (env variables, specified usage limits etc)
        - The other pods could be the TF-Serving deployment
            - Needs more resources to serve a model
            - All the same image and config

Services organize entrypoints for deployment
    - "service" ~= entrypoint/routing of an application. Routes requests to pod
    - E.g. When user sends request to gateway, will use the K8s Gateway service as the point of contact
        - This K8s service is responsible to send requests to pods
        - Spreads traffic over available pods
    - E.g. K8s Gateway service passes image to a Gateway Pod
        - These pods then go to the K8s Model service to route requests to a Model pod
        - Prediction goes back to Gateway service and sends result back to user
    - Services are only externably accessible if needed
        - E.g. K8s Gateway serice is external, K8s Model service is not
    - "external" ~= load balancer
    - "internal" ~= cluster IP

Have Ingress that actually talks to outside world
    - This routes to any "external" services

If needed, K8s scales up by adding pods for a necessary service to handle more traffic
- E.g. When there are many users, K8s spins up more Gateway pods
- Will scale back down when load decreases

If traffic requires more hardware resources, HPA will request another node
- This is considered "horizontal"
- Vertical is adding more resources to a pod

## Recap
- "nodes" ~= server/computer (EC2 instance)
- "pods" ~= container with specific parameters
- "deployment" ~= group of pods with same image/configuration
- "service" ~= entrypoint/routing of an application. Routes requests to pod
- "external" ~= load balancer
- "internal" ~= cluster IP
- "ingress" ~= cluster entrypoint
- "HPA" = Horizontal Pod autoscaler (adds more pods)
