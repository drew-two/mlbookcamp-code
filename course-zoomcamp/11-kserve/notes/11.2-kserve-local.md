# 11.2 - Running KServe Locally

Create cluster for KServe. Start Docker if on Windows
- NOTE: Check if old clusters exist with Kind. Delete if need be
    - `kind get clusters`
    - `kind delete cluster`

Go to KServe website's [Getting Started](https://kserve.github.io/website/master/get_started/#install-the-kserve-quickstart-environment)
- Need `kind` (Kubernetes in Docker)
- Need `kubectl`
- Install KServe "Quickstart" environment
    - See [quick_install.sh](./quick_install.sh)
    - Install a bunch of things KServe needs
        - Istio, Knative, KServe, Cert manager
- Can see the tools it uses on the main page:
    - ![KServe](https://kserve.github.io/website/master/images/kserve_layer.png)
    - KNative and Istio are serverless layer
- Install quick_install.sh
    - You can edit the ISTIO version. May need to make it >1.15.0
        - Alexey chooses 1.62.0
    - May need to start from scratch to reinstall different version
        - `istio-<version>/bin/istioctl x uninstall --purge`
        - `rm -rf istio-<version>/`
    - Rerun `bash quick_install.sh`
- Istio install ingress gateways
    - Helps KServe know which InferenceService to send request to

Running the script takes a long time during the `Processing resources...` stage in video so he debugs
- Runs `kubectl get namespaces` to check istio system
- Runs `kubectl get pod -n istio-system`
    - Sees 2 'istiod' pods. One is running, one is pending
    - He checks why it is pending with `kubectl describe pod -n istio-system <pod-name>`
        - Insufficent CPU: Turns out his EC2 system was just not powerful enough. He spun up another
- On new EC2 he reinstalls `kind`, `kubectl` and `kserve`
