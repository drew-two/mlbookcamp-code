# 1.10 Summary

## 1.1 Introduction to ML
- Introduced car price prediction example
    - Looked at the features
        - The characteristics of the car. Everything we know
    - The target, what we want to predict. (The price here)
    - We feed these to a machine learning algorithm, and the output is a model
        - Can later use this model to predict prices
    - Feeding a certain car, say an Audi, to the model, will return the possible price of the car.

## 1.2 Rules vs ML
- Manually analyze data and try to find patterns. Try to encode these patterns as rules
    - Can easily become too cumbersome over time
- Machine learning we do not have this problem as models extract patterns themselves.
    - Use statistics to find the patterns present in the features.

## 1.3 Supervised Machine Learning
- Can model ML as *g*(*X*) â‰ˆ *y*
    - *g* is the model. This extracts patterns from the data
    - *X* is the features. We train the model on this, and get something as close as possible to *y*
    - *y* is the target, the information we want to predict.
        - This is what we want to learn to find

## 1.4 CRISP-DM
- Like the Software Development Life Cycle
- In addition to modelling (simply step 4) this is only the middle step:
    1. **Business understanding:** An important question is if do we need ML for the project. The goal of the project has to be measurable. 
    2. **Data understanding:** Analyze available data sources, and decide if more data is required. 
    3. **Data preparation:** Clean data and remove noise applying pipelines, and the data should be converted to a tabular format, so we can put it into ML.
    4. **Modeling:** training Different models and choose the best one. Considering the results of this step, it is proper to decide if is required to add new features or fix data issues. 
    5. **Evaluation:** Measure how well the model is performing and if it solves the business problem. 
    6. **Deployment:** Roll out to production to all the users. The evaluation and deployment often happen together - **online evaluation**. 
- Need to deploy. Without this a model is just not useful

## 1.5 Model Selection
- The process of selecting the best model
    1. Split datasets in training, validation, and test. E.g. 60%, 20% and 20% respectively 
    2. Train the models
    3. Evaluate the models
    4. Select the best model 
    5. Apply the best model to the test dataset 
    6. Compare the performance metrics of validation and test 
- Validation dataset is for finding the best model
- Test dataset is to doublecheck and make sure we did not pick a model with good results on just one subset of the data.

## 1.6 Environment
- Install Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn
- Anacondas is the easiest option for environment managemant
- Can also create AWS environment for Data Science

## 1.7 Introduction to NumPy
- Python library for manipulating numerical data
- Different operations that are useful for Data Science and Machine Learning

## 1.8 Linear Algebra Refresher
- Multiplication for scalars, vectors and matrices
    - Scalar-Vector multiplication (*x* x *v*)
        - Multiply value by every element of vector
    - Vector-Vector multiplication (*u<sup>T</sup>* x *v*)
        - Can express this as repeated and summed scalar-vector multiplication
    - Matrix-Vector multiplication (*U* x *v*)
        - Can express this as repeated vector-vector multiplication
    - Matrix-Matrix multiplication (*U* x *V*)
        - Can express this as repeated matrix-vector multiplication
- Formulae are not scary when you implement them 

## 1.9 Introduction to Pandas
- Python library for dealing with tabular data (including Strings)
- Main data structure is DataFrame
- Talked about common operations with Pandas
