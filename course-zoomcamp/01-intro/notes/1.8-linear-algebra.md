# Linear Algebra Refresher

## Vector Operations

### Scalar Multiplication
- To multiply a scalar by a vector, multiply every element of the vector by the scalar.

- Typically, in linear algebra, vectors are columns, not rows.
- NumPy does this different for readability

### Vector Addition
- Add each element to its corresponding element in the other vector.

## Multiplication

### Vector-vector multiplication
- Also called dot product, or unit product
- NOT just element-wise, multiply each element by the corresponding element and sum

- If first matrix is n x 1 and second is n x 1, you get a 1 x 1 answer

### Transpose
- Operation that turns columns into rows.
- For multiplication you would need one row and one column vector, so you need to transpose one.

Implementing vector-vector multiplication
```
def vector_vector_multiplication(u, v):
    assert u.shape[0] == v.shape[0]

    n = u.shape[0]

    result = 0.0

    for i in range(n):
        result = result + u[i] * v[i]

    return result
```
- In NumPy we actually go from i = 0 to i = n-1
- This exists in NumPy though: `u.dot(v)`

### Matrix-vector multiplication
- Multiply each row of *u* by vector *v*
    - Sum the multiplications
    - Store them in a matrix *n* x *n*, where *u* is *n* x *m* and *v* is *m* x 1

- Computation of output matrix:

Implementing matrix-vector multiplication
```
def matrix_vector_multiplication(U, v):
    assert U.shape[1] == v.shape[0]

    num_rows = U.shape[0]

    result = np.zeros(num_rows)

    for i in range(num_rows):
        result[i] = vector_vector_multiplication(U[i], v)

    return result
```

### Matrix-matrix multiplication
- Essentially repeated matrix-vector multiplication
    - If we are doing *U* x *V*, treat each column of *V* as a vector
- Store result in a matrix *n* x *n*, where *u* is *n* x *m* and *v* is *m* x *n* 
<img src="../images/1.8-matrix-matrix-mult.png" alt="Matrix-Matrix Multiplication" width=750/>

```
def matrix_vector_multiplication(U, V):
    assert U.shape[1] == V.shape[0]

    num_rows = U.shape[0]
    num_cols = V.shape[1]

    result = np.zeros((num_rows, num_cols))

    for i in range(num_cols):
        vi = V[:, i]
        Uvi = matrix_vector_multiplication(U, vi)
        result[:,  i] = Uvi

    return result
```

- Can do this in plain NumPy with `U.dot(V)`

### Identity Matrix
- A square matrix with 1's down the diagonal, that is only *U<sub>00</sub>*, *U<sub>11</sub>*, ... *U<sub>nn</sub>*
<img src="../images/1.8-identity.png" alt="Identity Matrix" width=750/>
- Like the number 1 and a scalar, multiplying by the identity matrix always returns the multiplied matrix back.
    - Works with any matrix *U* that can be multiplied by *I* (so one dimension can differ)
- Created in NumPy with `np.eye(n)`

### Matrix Inverse
- Only for square matrices, the inverse is of *A* is *A<sup>-1</sup>* such that *AA<sup>-1</sup>*=*I*
- In NumPy under np.linalg.inv(*U*)
    - Useful to get the Identity matrix in NumPy
