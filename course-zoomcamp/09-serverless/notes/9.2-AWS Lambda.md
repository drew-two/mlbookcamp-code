# 9.2 - AWS Lambda

Go to the [AWS Lambda Console](console.aws.amazon.com/lambda)
- Runs code without servers. Just need to write function
    - No need for EC2 instances, Kubernetes clusters etc
    - Conversely, Elastic Beanstalk creates a server under the hood 

## Create
Hit `Create function` > Author from scratch
- Give it appropriate name
- Runtime: Python 3.9
- Architecture: x86_64
- Hit `Create function`

## See Code
Scroll down to Code Source
- There is nothing here but lambda_function.py
    - Starts with just `def lambda_handler(event, context):`
- Remove the internals of the function
    - Replace with `return "PONG"`
- Look at the parameters
    - `event` contains whatever JSON is passed to the function
        - Add `print("parameters:", event)`
    - `context` usually contains nothing

## Testing
Hit `Test` to configure test event
- Event JSON is what will be passed to `event`
    - Will be passed as dictionary to JSON, then back to dictionary in the function
- Just name it 'test' or something
- Hit `Create`
- Hit `Test` to run
    - Notice you are not getting the correct response
    - Have to hit `Deploy` first
- Now hit `Test`
    - Now you can see PONG and the parameter we passed

## Accessing the JSON
Go back to configuring the test
- Change JSON to one variable url with some dummy text
- Hit `Save`
- To see URL, add this code:
    - ```
        url = event['url']
        results = predict(url)
        return results
        ```

## Why Use Lambda?
In short, AWS Lambda just needs a function, and to use it
- Don't have to think about infrastructure for serving models
- Pay per request - only when it is doing something, not idle

When your traffic is mostly during the day, you only have to pay then.
- At night, when you have little traffic, you do not need to pay for overhead
- Lambda is somewhat expensive though

Example: Alexey's join-datatalks-club function
- Keeps slack invite URL in Environment variables on his website
- Can just replace URL variable when needed
- **Does not pay anything**: it does not get enough usage

## Cleanup
Scroll up and hit `Actions` > `Delete function`
