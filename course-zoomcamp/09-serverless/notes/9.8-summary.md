# 9.8 - Summary

1. Used AWS Lambda to quickly deploy code without having to think about servers
    - Need to make Python script with function `lambda_handler`
        - Can actually be called anything - just need to specify in Dockerfile
    - ONLY pay for invocations - low invocations applications are cheap
        - High volume requests can easily be expensive - easily over $1000/month/service
    - Packaged with Docker
        - Can package, run, and test locally
2. Packaged in Docker image pushed to ECR then lambda
    - May need to increase timeout and add RAM
2. Tensorflow-Lite is a lightweight package to just use Tensorflow for inference
    - Requires more lines than `.predict()` - much more verbose
    - Much smaller than entire Tensorflow package though - 2MB vs ~200MB for Mac, 400+ for Windows
4. Exposed AWS Lambda via API Gateway
    - Easy way to map 'resources' (AWS managed services you use) to API URL and expose to world
