# 9.7 - API Gateway: Exposing the Lambda Function

Now we will expose Lambda function as webservice. API Gateway is an AWS managed service allowing you to expose endpoints

Go to [API Gateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/)
- Hit `Create API` > REST API > `Build
    - Add name
    - `Create API`

This is a REST API, so we need to add a resource
- Normally this is a verb, or noun
- Actions > Create Resource
    - Here we will call it with a verb ('predict')
        - Convention is to have endpoint like `/predict`
        - Hit `Create Resource`
- Click resource. Hit Actions > Create Method
    - Make it a POST method
    - Specify Lambda Function (should autocomplete)
    - Default settings are okay
    - Hit `Save`
        - Will ask to adjust role permissions. Hit `Okay`

Test the function - hit the thunderbolt to the left
- Only need to add Request Body:
    - `{"url": "http://bit.ly/mlbookcamp-pants"}` again
- Should work. Can see statistics
    - See status 200, took ~7 seconds
    - Lots of uninteresting information
- Test again
    - Faster now - ~4 ms

Now want to deploy API
- Hit Actions > Deploy API
    - Create new stage
    - `Create`
- Get new API URL by going under the deploy API and getting it from `/predict`
    - Take [test.py](../test.py) and add the URL
    - Should be like 'https://[0-9][a-z].execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test/predict'
- Should get the response like you did in [9.6](9.6-creating-lambda.md)
- Right now this Lambda function is open to the world
    - Do NOT want to do this for work or something
