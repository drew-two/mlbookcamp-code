# 9.6 - Creating the Lambda Function

Go back to [AWS Lambda](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- Hit `Create function`
    - Select `Container image`
    - Specify Container image URI
        - Need to do this with [Amazon ECR](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr)
        - Need to create image repo and then push image there
        - Will do via CLI (`pip install awscli`). Can do everything web interface can do
            - Run `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name clothing-model-tflite-images` to create repo
            - Get response like:
            ```
            {
                "repository": {
                    "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-2:<AWS user ID>:repository/clothing-model-tflite-images",
                    "registryId": "<AWS user ID>",
                    "repositoryName": "clothing-model-tflite-images",
                    "repositoryUri": "<AWS user ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/clothing-model-tflite-images",
                    "createdAt": 1669692503.0,
                    "imageTagMutability": "MUTABLE",
                    "imageScanningConfiguration": {
                        "scanOnPush": false
                    }
                }
            }
            ```
            - Need `repositoryUri` to push image
        - Should see repository in web interface now
        - Now need to log into registry. Run `aws ecr get-login --no-include-email`
            - Use `--no-include-email` to just get password back
            - Will show password. Be careful
                - Can add `| sed 's/[0-9a-zA-Z=]\{20,\}/PASSWORD/g'`
            - Now want to save original command output:
                - `$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email)`
            - This logged in with Docker
        - Create Bash script with your:
            - Account #
            - Region
            - Registry name
            - Registry URL (build with Acc #, region and registry name)
            - Use to get full Remote URI (prefix then tag)
        - Tag image for repo (use `docker images | head` to find image name/tag again)
            - `docker tag clothing-model:latest ${REMOTE_URI}`
        - Push to ECR with `docker push ${REMOTE_URI}`
        - Should be able to see it in repo
    - Back in AWS Lambda console - add container image URI
        - Can hit `Browse images` also
            - Uses image digest rather than tag - doesn't matter
    - Add function name
    - `Create function`
- Function should be up
    - Cannot see code as it is container based
    - Go to Test 
        - Name it pants
        - Add "url" to JSON pointing to "http://bit.ly/mlbookcamp-pants"
        - Save
    - Test. Should fail
        - `Task timed out after 3.09 seconds`
        - Default timeout is 3 seconds. Not enough for this
        - Go to Configuration > General configuration > `Edit`
            - Set "Timeout" to 30 seconds
                - Should be sufficient for cold start
            - Set Memory to 1GB (1024 MB)
    - Test again. Should succeed
        - Same output as before but just from Lambda
        - Can see some statistics:
            - ~5.5 init time
            - ~10 seconds run time
            - 269 MB used
        - Run again - should be faster
            - No init time
            - ~2s run time
    - Not super fast, but not bad

## Pricing
Can see at [AWS Lambda Rising](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/)
- Price different per reason
- Can see by amount of memory used:
    - us-east-2
    - 1024 MB: $0.0000000167
- Price is about $0.0000000167 * 2000 ms
    - About $0.0000334
    - For 10,000 images, ~$0.3339999
    - For 1M images, ~$33.4
- Price is a bit less on ARM - $0.0000000167 * 2000 ms
    - For 1M images, ~$26.6

Great for low traffic models - expensive if you get a lot of traffic
- 1M images over 30 days is ~$1k just for one model service
