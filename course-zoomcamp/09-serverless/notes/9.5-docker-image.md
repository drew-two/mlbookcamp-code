# 9.5 - Preparing a Docker Image

First need to create [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile)
- First we will import image
    - Can see public AWS images in the [AWS ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/)
    - Find the Python Lambda [image](https://gallery.ecr.aws/lambda/python/)
    - Scroll down to see image tags, get 3.8
    - Enter `FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.8` in Dockerfile
- Add `RUN pip install ...` to Python packages
    - `RUN pip install keras-image-helper tflite-runtime`
    - Don't need to install PIL or NumPy because KIH relies on the former and tflite on the latter
- Copy in the model: `COPY clothing-model.tflite .`
- Copy in the lambda function: `COPY lambda_function.py .`
- Need to tell AWS Lambda how to access function
    - `CMD [ "lambda_function.lambda_handler" ]`

Build model with `docker build -t clothing-model .`
- Test with `docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 clothing-model:latest`
- Create [script](test.py) to test this:
    - `import requests`
    - Add url variable: 'http://localhost:8080/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations'
        - Something AWS chose
    - Add data variable. Dictionary with url entry (for image)
    - Use `requests.post` to send `data` to `url` as JSON and get the result

Get an error testing the python file
- In Lambda we use AWS Linux, but TFLite was compiled for Ubuntu or Debian or something
    - AWS Linux is CentOS based though
    - Error says `GLIBC` is available in Ubuntu but not Lambda
    - Thus need to compile TFLite for AWS Lambda
- Alexey has compiled versions on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda)
    - Webpage shows how to compile for different versions of Python and Tensorflow
    - Copy link for TF 2.7.0 and Python 3.8 (https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/blob/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl)
    - Add the following line to Do  ckerfile:
        - `RUN pip install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl`
    - **NOTE**: only used `pip install` and not `pipenv` because TFLite is kind of 'tricky'
        - It needs different versions of native libraries
        - Needs different binaries for local env and for Dockerfile
- Rebuild Docker image now
- Test again

Get error `Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable`
- Had this error in previous weeks with Flask
- Need to convert the NumPy arrays into usual Python floats
- Should be making a function, but you can do:
    - `float_predictions = preds[0].tolist()`
    - `return dict(zip(classes, float_predictions))`
- Now try to test again
- Works now

## Recap
- Made Dockerfile for AWS Lambda for Python 3.8
    - Installed packages, imported model, added CMD for AWS Lambda
- Used precompiled TF-Lite binary for AWS Lambda
- Had code return Python float arrays instead of NumPy arrays
- Tested against running Docker image
